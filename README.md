# academic-research-recommender
Web application that uses natural language processing to recommend academic papers similar to what is inputted.

Could not host or fully upload or files here as the database itself is 4GB and contains hundreds of thousands of academic papers (sourced ethically of course). Everything other than the database is uploaded, however.

Uses a neural network made in Tensorflow using a Google Colab notebook. I used Tensorflow and not Keras as it meant it could be converted to TensorFlowJS and be used directly in my web application. I know now there are other methods of using python code in a web application but hindsight is 20/20.
